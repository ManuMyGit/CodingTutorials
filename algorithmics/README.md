# Algorithmics
In this tutorial I cover the most important topics about theory of algorithms:
- [Big 0 notation](https://github.com/ManuMyGit/CodingTutorials/tree/main/algorithmics/bigo.md): deep dive into Big O.
- [Data structures](https://github.com/ManuMyGit/CodingTutorials/tree/main/algorithmics/datastructures.md): deep dive into type of data structures, as well as its operations complexity.
- [Sorting data](https://github.com/ManuMyGit/CodingTutorials/tree/main/algorithmics/sortingdata.md): deep dive into sorting algorithms.
- [Solving problems](https://github.com/ManuMyGit/CodingTutorials/tree/main/algorithmics/problemssolving.md): recommendations, steps and examples about how to solve an algorithmics problem in an interview.
