# INTRODUCTION
NoSQL databases, often referred to as "not only SQL," provide a flexible and scalable approach to managing and querying data. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases do not use a fixed schema and can handle a wide variety of data structures. They are commonly used for applications that require high performance, massive scalability, and availability.

# TYPE OF NOSQL DATABASES
We can categorize NoSQL databases in four types:
- [Document stores](https://github.com/ManuMyGit/CodingTutorials/blob/main/database/nosql/document/README.md)
- [Key-Value stores](https://github.com/ManuMyGit/CodingTutorials/blob/main/database/nosql/keyvalue/README.md)
- Column-Family stores
- Graph databases

## Document stores
Document stores store data in a schema-less format, typically using JSON or XML documents. Each document can have a different structure, allowing for easy changes to the data model. Examples include MongoDB and Couchbase.

Document stores are great for applications with dynamic or evolving schemas. They are suitable for content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and applications that require frequent updates to the data model. MongoDB, for example, is often used for building scalable web applications.

If your application requires flexible schemas and frequent data changes, consider using a document store like MongoDB.

## Key-Value stores
Key-value stores are the simplest type of NoSQL databases. Data is stored as key-value pairs, and each key is unique. These databases are efficient for caching and storing simple data structures. Examples include Redis and Amazon DynamoDB.

Key-value stores are efficient for caching frequently accessed data and managing session information. They are used in applications where fast read and write operations are crucial, such as real-time analytics, leaderboard systems, and content delivery networks. Redis is commonly employed as an in-memory data store.

For caching and managing session data, key-value stores like Redis are a strong choice due to their fast read and write operations.

## Column-Family stores
Column-family stores organize data into column families, where each column family contains multiple rows with varying columns. They are suitable for handling vast amounts of data with different structures. Examples include Apache Cassandra and HBase.

Column-family stores are well-suited for scenarios involving massive amounts of data with varying attributes. They are often used for time-series data, log analysis, and applications requiring fast writes and complex querying. Apache Cassandra is used by many large-scale systems to manage vast volumes of data.

When dealing with large volumes of data with varying attributes, consider using column-family stores such as Apache Cassandra.

## Graph databases
Graph databases are designed to store and manage graph-like structures, where entities (nodes) are connected by relationships (edges). They excel in scenarios requiring complex relationships and traversals. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.

Graph databases are ideal for applications that heavily rely on relationships, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection systems. They allow for efficient traversals of complex networks, making it easy to answer queries about connections and patterns. Neo4j, for instance, is frequently used to build social networking platforms.

If your application revolves around complex relationships, graph databases like Neo4j are optimal for efficient traversal and querying.
